        <h1>Who is Sri Sathya Sai Baba?</h1>
        Sri Sathya Sai Baba is one of the most highly revered spiritual masters of our time. He is lovingly addressed as Baba or Swami by millions across the World. Sai Baba means Divine Father and Divine Mother. His life and messages have inspired millions of people throughout the world.  People are drawn to Him and His teachings as bees are to honey, for the simplicity with which He has elucidated the most profound and fundamental truths mentioned in world religions.
        Millions of people around the world from different religions worship Him as an Avatar (Sanskrit) or God who has come in a human form to transform the world.  On His advent as an Avatar, Baba declared, “The Lord incarnates in a human form to bless and rescue those who cannot rise to the level of the Divine. Incarnation is an act of benediction”.
        His life reflected His message and He often said, “My Life is My Message”.  He never sought to start a new religion. On this, He declared, “All religions are facets of the same truth.  I have come not to disturb or destroy any faith, but to confirm each in his own faith, so that the Christian becomes a better Christian; the Muslim, a better Muslim; and the Hindu, a better Hindu.”
        Baba was born on November 23, 1926 in a small village called Puttaparthi in the state of Andhra Pradesh in South India. Even as a child, Baba demonstrated exemplary qualities of compassion, sacrifice, tolerance, selfless love, and wisdom. It wasn’t until 1940 that Baba declared that His Mission was waiting for Him and He would have to yield to the prayers of his devotees.   He declared, “I have come to light the lamp of love in your hearts, to see that it shines day by day with added lustre.  I have not come on any mission of publicity for any sect or creed or cause, nor have I come to collect followers for my doctrine. I have come to tell you of this unitary faith, this spiritual principle, this path of Love, this virtue of Love, this duty of Love, this obligation to Love.”
        Baba lived in the ashram, Prashanti Nilayam (Abode of Peace) till the age of 84. Millions around the world came to be in His physical presence and receive His Love and Grace. On April 24, 2011, Baba left his physical body. Millions, who sought to be in His physical presence in Prashanti Nilayam, now feel him as the indweller of their spiritual hearts.
        <h1>Sri Sathya Sai Organization</h1>
        The Sathya Sai Organization provides a platform where spiritual seekers learn, practice and share the teachings of Baba, the common thread weaving through them being Love. The Organization seeks to transform the world by helping its members to  spiritually transform themselves.
        About the main objective of the Sathya Sai Organization, Baba said, “The Sai Organization is simply a gathering together of people who have a common goal in personal development and in helping man to recognize the divinity that is inherent in him. The Sai Organization should be motivated by Love. You join the Organization to give, to receive, to progress, to learn, to become inspired and to serve; to ensure that all human relations are governed by the principles of  Truth, Right Conduct, Peace, Non-violence and Love.  Your duty is to emphasize the One, to experience the One in all you do or speak. Do not give any importance to differences of religion or sect or status or color. Have the feeling of oneness permeate every act of yours”.  Founded by Sathya Sai Baba, the Sathya Sai Organization has made its presence felt around the world, quietly ushering in timeless values of Truth, Love, Right Conduct, Peace and Non-Violence in everyday lives.
        <h1>Sri Sathya Sai Community Centre, Brossard, QC</h1>
        In Canada, there are 35 Sai centres that come under the umbrella of the International Sathya Sai Organization, which is involved in service activities in 140 countries. The Sri Sathya Sai Community Centre is a registered charitable organization, and does not have any political or religious affiliation. Spirituality being the undercurrent of the Sai organization, the organization is equipped with four wings – Spiritual, Education, Service, and Youth – to undertake events that enrich the spirit and reflect the teachings of Sathya Sai Baba.
        <h1>About us</h1>
        The Sri Sathya Sai Community Centre, Brossard QC, has members from different races and religions. They work as one to “Love all, Serve all” as taught by  Sathya Sai Baba.  The multicultural Community Centre was envisaged 18 years ago by members from different faiths at an open house organized by the then Sathya Sai Centre, Vancouver.
        <h1>Open House</h1>
        Every Saturday morning there is Open House, which welcomes men and women of all backgrounds who wish to learn about Sathya Sai Baba – “the Holy man of India”.  (The first Open House was organized at the Sri Sathya Sai Centre, Vancouver, in 1995.  That Centre became, a few years ago, the present Sri Sathya Sai Community Centre.). There are volunteers at the Centre from different cultures and faiths who love sharing any information about Sathya Sai Baba. Newcomers interact with long-time Baba devotees who may share the same spiritual yearnings. From an impressive collection of Sai literature in the library, the attendees are encouraged to borrow books, DVDs, CDs, many of which are donated by Baba devotees. These are available for borrowing and purchase on Thursdays, Saturdays and Sundays.  The volunteers help newcomers pick out videos about Baba’s life, His teachings, His work and His Mission.  The open house concept has led to many activities that have continued for the past several years. A Chinese language fellowship and a Japanese language fellowship have been formed by those who wanted to learn and sing Sai bhajans (devotional singing) in their own language. The volunteers assisting with the open house help these groups with a large collection of Sai literature, in both Chinese and Japanese, from the centre’s library.  The Open House has become the heart of communal activities for newcomers to the Community Centre, and a hub for spiritual discussion.
        <h1>Our Mission</h1>
        Built on a bedrock of spiritual values, the Sri Sathya Sai Community Centre believes that if it is to be considered a community centre in the truest sense of the term, and its members are to be seen as true followers of Baba and His teachings, then all of its activities should reflect His messages.  These activities should bring human values of love and peace to society. Baba helps us all to see the All in One and the One in All. Hence loving service is the prime motivation of this centre as it strives to serve the community that has so lovingly housed it. Sri Sathya Sai Community Centre hopes to serve society and to be a haven for spiritual seekers. “Where the road ends, God is attained and the pilgrim finds he has journeyed from himself to himself. Only spiritual transformation can bring about social welfare”- Baba
